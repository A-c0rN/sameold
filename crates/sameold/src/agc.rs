//! Automatic gain control

///
/// The `Agc` attempts to normalize the output signal
/// level to an average output absolute value of 1.0.
/// This makes a full-scale sinusoid range from
/// -1.0 to +1.0.
///
/// While floating-point numbers are *relatively*
/// insensitive to loss of arithmetic precision,
/// symbol timing recovery works best when the output
/// has a known signal level. The `Agc` helps make
/// this happen.

/// The `Agc` uses a simple feedback filter with a
/// single tap. It can be locked to prevent its
